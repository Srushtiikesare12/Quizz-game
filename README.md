Quiz Game Project

Introduction
I am excited to share my first Python project, a simple Quiz Game, which marks the beginning of my programming journey. This project demonstrates my understanding of basic Python concepts and serves as a foundation for more complex projects in Data Science.

Project Overview
This Quiz Game is designed to test users' knowledge in various areas. The game allows users to answer questions and keep track of their scores. Although this implementation is basic, it showcases my ability to design and develop a simple program using Python.

Future Plans and Roadmap
As I continue to progress in my Data Science journey, my next steps will focus on developing more sophisticated projects that integrate machine learning, data visualization, and natural language processing. I aim to apply my skills to real-world problems and contribute to the Data Science community.

Technologies Used
- Python 3.x

Acknowledgments
